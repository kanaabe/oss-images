Artsy's public API only serves images that are in the Public Domain. I came across the need recently to do some image searching for only the public domain images. This repo uses [Ezel](http://ezeljs.com/) and provides a simple search tool for finding images via a gene keyword.

Run this app by obtaining an Artsy API client and secret [here](http://developers.artsy.net)
